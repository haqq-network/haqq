*************************
https://docs.haqq.network/quickstart/interact_node.html#:~:text=The%20list%20of%20all%20available%20REST%20endpoints%20is%20available%20as%20a%20Swagger%20specification%20file%2C%20it%20can%20be%20viewed%20at%20localhost%3A1317/swagger.

The above linked text in the documentation says there is a list of available REST endpoints as a Swagger specification file. However, with the api.swagger field set to true in the app.toml file, calling http://localhost:1317/swagger URL produces empty result. Also, you can view the result here: http://206.189.234.163:1317/swagger . I suggest fixing it.
