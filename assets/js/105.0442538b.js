However, there is an incentive to include more than ⅔ precommits in the form of a bonus. The bonus is linear: it ranges from 1% if the proposer includes ⅔rd precommits (minimum for the block to be valid) to 5% if the proposer includes 100% precommits. Of course the proposer should not wait too long or other validators may timeout and move on to the next proposer. As such, validators have to find a balance between wait-time to get the most signatures and risk of losing out on proposing the next block. This mechanism aims to incentivize non-empty block proposals, better networking between validators as well as to mitigate censorship.")]),t._v(" "),e("p",[t._v("Let's take a concrete example to illustrate the aforementioned concept.
